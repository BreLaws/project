    "text": "This research aims to analyze the language used by United States newspapers in reference organizations identified as “terrorist groups” by the United States government. The following research questions are address:\n\nWhat variations can be seen in the language used by American media outlets in reference to international terrorist groups?\nWhere are there discrepancies between how governmental bodies identify groups and how the media identifies terrorist groups?\nWhat might these discrepancies mean?\nDoes less inflammatory language or less acknowledgement of a group’s “terrorist” status affect reader opinions?\n\n\n\nThis section will contain my analysis of various sources that inform my thinking. I will come back to it to fully flesh it out at a later date.\nI will practice inserting the citations here: Rafeeq (2023), Amer (2017), Alnwihe and Al-Abbas (2023)\nThese sources do a good job at identifying media language surrounding large conflicts. One of the studies contains a comparative analysis of US and UK press coverage of the Gaza War of 2008-2009 (Amer2017-df?). Another article speaks to the concept of specialized rhetoric in othering various groups and how the language that the speakers use further this effort Alnwihe and Al-Abbas (2023).\nMany articles talk about the general bias of media and how this manifests in individual outlets’ language. However, I want to narrow this research down specifically to the language of the media surrounding various groups that have been identified as “terrorist groups” by governmental bodies. For example, Associated Press Style guidelines instruct journalists to refer to Hamas as a militant group, rather than a terrorist group, which is how they are identified by the US State Department as a terrorist group.\nMy research is not to determine what is right or wrong but, rather, to see the language choices various outlets make when confronted with the choice of whether to use the risky word “terrorist” in their publications. Furthermore, I want to examine how these word choices may or may not affect the attitudes of readers toward various groups and toward the notion of US interference with these groups.",
